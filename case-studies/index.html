The museum's most prized asset however is the collection of works by Piet Mondrian, which is the biggest in the world, spanning his entire career. We are using TAP as our new multimediatour system. We added a different multi-language option and cross-bundle search (which was later rendered superfluous because we opted for putting everything in a single bundle, but still).</div>

                        <div>Winona State has partnered with the Winona County Historical Society (WCHS) and Winona360.org to produce a mobile walking tour website. This project is intended to interface with a new exhibit being planned at the WCHS: “Identities in Brick & Stone”, highlighting several significant buildings in downtown Winona, MN. The mobile website utilizes new features in HTML5 (geolocation), to guide users on a walking tour of these locations. This has primarily been a student developed project that has been run with staff (me) and faculty oversight.</div>
