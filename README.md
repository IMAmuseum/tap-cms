Note*
The most recent code contains changes that may break any existing implementations of the Tap Web App and Tap iOS. An update to accommodate these changes should be released soon.

## TAP

TAP aims to provide tools to easily create and deliver mobile tour applications in a museum setting. Content creation is performed in the content management system, Drupal. TAP tours are exportable into an intermediate format, TourML, which can then be used as pluggable bundles for mobile applications.
